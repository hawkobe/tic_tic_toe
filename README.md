# tic_tic_toe

My first real Ruby project! Did my best at coding a program to run Tic Tac Toe in the command line.

There are a few things I find verbose, or redundant, for this specific game, one of which being the methods under "board.rb" for the board class that define rows and columns -- I know those aren't neccessary for the logic but thought it would be nice for someone to be able to access the rows or columns if they needed.

I also wrote the initialize for the board in a way so it used variables instead of a hard coded array, in order to facilitate scale, in case someone wanted to create a bigger board than 3 X 3 using this class for a different game.

I still have a lot of Ruby to learn, and want to keep practicing so my code is more concise and less verbose or redundant.

Enjoy!
